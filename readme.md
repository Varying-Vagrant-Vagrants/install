# VVV Installer

A 1 line install script for Intel Macs and Linux. Heavily inspired by the homebrew installer script (this is why we use their license instead of MIT).

## Install VVV (on macOS or Linux)

Copy paste this into a terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
